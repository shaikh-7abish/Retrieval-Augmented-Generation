# Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Llama 3.2-1b and Chain/Retriever

This repository demonstrates a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built upon the powerful Llama 3.2-1b language model. The system leverages a modular architecture utilizing the LangChain framework, incorporating a chain for orchestrating the generation process and a retriever for efficient information retrieval.

## Key Features:

- Modular Architecture:
  - Employs the LangChain framework for a modular and flexible system.
  - Utilizes a chain to define the sequence of operations: retrieval, generation, and post-processing.
  - Allows for easy customization and experimentation with different components.
- Data Ingestion & Retrieval:
  - Supports diverse data formats: PDF, text files, web pages, and more.
  - Implements robust data preprocessing and cleaning techniques.
Leverages a dedicated retriever (e.g., DocumentLoader, FAISS Retriever) for efficient and relevant information retrieval.
Supports various retrieval strategies: keyword matching, semantic search, and hybrid approaches.
- Llama 3.2-1b Integration:
Integrates the powerful Llama 3.2-1b language model for high-quality text generation.
Leverages the model's capabilities for tasks like summarization, question answering, and creative writing.
- Customizable Generation:
Allows for flexible control over generation parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p, max_tokens).
Enables fine-tuning of the Llama model on specific domains or tasks.
Supports various generation tasks, including summarization, question answering, and creative writing.
- Usage:

Data Preparation:
Prepare your data in supported formats.
Use the provided scripts to preprocess and index your data.
Chain Configuration:
Define the RAG chain by specifying the retriever, LLM, and any necessary prompts or post-processing steps.
RAG Interaction:
Query the system with your input (e.g., a question, a topic).
The chain will orchestrate the retrieval of relevant information and the generation of text using Llama 3.2-1b.
